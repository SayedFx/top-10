      <h3>END-TO-END ENCRYPTION</h3>
      <h2>Security by Default</h2>
      <p>
        Some of your most personal moments are shared on WhatsApp, which is why
        we built end-to-end encryption into the latest versions of our app. When
        end-to-end encrypted, your messages and calls are secured so only you
        and the person you're communicating with can read or listen to them, and
        nobody in between, not even WhatsApp.
